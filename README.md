## Getting Started

### Installation

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mugunth140/portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see linting errors in the console.

### Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build, which can be previewed by running:

```bash
npm start
```

```

## Styling

This project uses SCSS for styling, organized in a modular way for maintainability:

- **Global Styles**: Defined in `globals.scss`, including base styles, typography, and resets.
- **Variables and Mixins**: Stored in `variables.scss` for easy management of theme-related settings like colors and typography.
- **Component Styles**: Each component has its own SCSS file to scope styles and avoid conflicts.

### Adding Styles

To add a new component style, simply create a new SCSS file in the `styles/components` directory and import it in the corresponding React component.

```scss
// Example: styles/components/Header.scss
.header {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Then, import it in the component:

```js
import '../styles/components/Header.scss';
```

## Deployment

The project is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for continuous integration and deployment. The setup is seamless with Next.js as Vercel offers one-click deployment for this framework.

### Steps to Deploy

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Every push to the `main` branch will trigger an automatic deployment.
3. Optionally, you can create environment variables on Vercel for things like API keys if required.
